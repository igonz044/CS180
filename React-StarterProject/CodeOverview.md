### Questions

* What exact role does node.js play vs. firebase?  Why not just one or the other?
  * Firebase is our database server
  * node.js is just used to run React and generate code
* Do we really need React?  Would be simpler to have a vanilla UI
  * What is React good for?  I guess updating the UI automatically after setState calls.  Point at the relevant code.
  
  
### Notes
* Built on create-react-app for simplicity
* React components
  * Reusable UI components
  * Simplify updates after async requests (need to understand better)


### Todo
* Need to document each file
* Graphic of overall architecture 
* Instructions on react web tools?
